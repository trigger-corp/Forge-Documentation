* ``forge create``
* ``forge build``
* ``forge run``

Reload has a number of commands which can be run from the command line:

* ``forge reload list``
* ``forge reload create``
* ``forge reload push``

These are explained in more detail in :ref:`reload`.

There are also some additional commands which may be used:

* ``forge check``: Perform some sanity checks on the app, including parsing the Javascript to check for syntax errors.
* ``forge migrate``: Migrate to the next version of Forge, you will be prompted to run this when it is available.

Run any command with the ``--help`` argument to see more information about the particular command.
