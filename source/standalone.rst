Standalone Build API
================================================================================

Although we expect most users to interact with Trigger.io Forge through our
command-line tools and browser-based toolkit, we also offer a standlone build
API to be used programmatically from other environments.

Using this build API, all of your HTML, CSS and JavaScript is uploaded to our
server, along with keys and certificates required for signing purposes. Once
the build is complete, the packages can be downloaded for a limited time
period.

Due to the nature of this API, builds may take longer to complete when compared
to conventional usage. If you are able to use the Trigger tooling, it is
recommended to do so.

API details

An example form is provided here: https://trigger.io/standalone/package

The various fields are described below:

                                                      use Keychain Access; for Windows, see

.. _standalone-usage:

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To package your app, use the ``/standalone/package`` endpoint::

    > curl \
        --header 'Accept: application/json' \
        --form email=james@trigger.io \
        --form password='my password' \
        --form src_zip=@my_app.zip \
        --form and_keystore=@debug.keystore \
        --form and_storepass=android \
        --form and_keyalias=androiddebugkey \
        --form and_keypass=android \
        -X POST \
        'https://trigger.io/standalone/package'
    {"id": "b0a05ec7-1683-40cc-b80b-716ba5d5067a", "result": "ok"}

This has started the packaging process and given you an ``id`` which you can
use to track the ongoing processing::

    > curl \
        --header 'Accept: application/json' \
        --data email=james@trigger.io \
        --data password='my password' \
        -G \
        'https://trigger.io/standalone/track/package/b0a05ec7-1683-40cc-b80b-716ba5d5067a'
    {"info": {"output": ""}, "state": "BUILDING", "id": "38b63a52-a35f-49fe-932a-39db3d82951a", "result": "ok"}

At this point, the build has started; repeated calls to
``/standalone/track/package`` will show when the processing has completed::

    > curl \
        --header 'Accept: application/json' \
        --data email=james@trigger.io \
        --data password='my password' \
        -G \
        'https://trigger.io/standalone/track/package/b0a05ec7-1683-40cc-b80b-716ba5d5067a'
    {"info": {
        "files": {
            "android": "https://trigger.io/media/993100fe3aa844c3ad11575e11aeb9fc/demo-1338404961.apk"
        },
        "output": "[   INFO] Forge tools running at version 3.3.0\n ..."
    },
    "state": "SUCCESS",
    "id": "38b63a52-a35f-49fe-932a-39db3d82951a",
    "result": "ok"}

We've formatted the last response for ease of viewing: the ``state`` property
transitioning to ``SUCCESS`` is the key point.

You are able to download the generated files from the URLs specified in the
``files`` hash.
