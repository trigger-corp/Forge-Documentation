``reload``: Push updates to deployed apps
=========================================

The Reload module allows you to update the HTML, CSS and JavaScript in your app for your users without you needing to push an App Store update or your users needing to re-install the app.

Config
------

The ``reload`` module must be enabled in ``config.json``, once the ``reload`` module is enabled you will be able to push updates to any builds of your app from that point.

            "reload": true

Concepts
--------

You can reload updates via the Toolkit UI. 

You can reload all of your users, or divide them into streams for A/B testing.

You can use the default update behavior without altering your code at all beyond including the reload module in the configuration. Or you can use the JavaScript API described here to have finer grain control over how reloads occur in your app.

How Reloads work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you reload a new version of your code through the Toolkit UI, users will see the new version of your code when they switch away from your app and switch back to it: we download updated files when focus is lost and apply the changes when focus is restored.

You have control over this process using the JavaScript API described here, but the default behavior does not require any change to your app's logic.

Streams
~~~~~~~

Streams let you segment your user base so that not everyone has to receive every update you push with Reload. This is useful for pushing regular unstable updates to developers, release candidates to beta testers and stable versions to the wider user base.

By default, your users are added to the “default” stream - you can create as many streams as you want, and switch apps to different streams using using the ``switchStream`` method described below.

Config versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 You must only reload HTML / CSS and JavaScript where it works with the minor version of the Forge platform which you originally built against.

If your updated JavaScript relies on Forge APIs that are only available in newer versions of the wrapper than your users currently have installed, then you will need to re-package your apps and deploy through the app stores again.

API
---

In order to use ``reload`` no API calls are required, however some apps may which to use the following API methods to force updates at a users request, or switch the user to an alternate streams.

``updateAvailable``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Platforms: Mobile**

Gives ``true`` or ``false`` depending on whether there is a ``reload`` update available to be downloaded.

.. js:function:: reload.updateAvailable(success, error)

    :param function(update_available) success: Called with whether or not an update is available.
    :param function(content) error: called with details of any error which may occur

``update``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Platforms: Mobile**

Forces the application to check for, and if available download a ``reload`` update. The update will then be applied the next time the app is closed or loses focus.

.. js:function:: reload.update(success, error)

    :param function() success: Called when an update is available and the download has started - see the ``updateReady`` event to be notified when the update is complete
    :param function(content) error: called with details of any error which may occur

``applyNow``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Platforms: Mobile**

.. warning:: This method is deprecated and does not do anything any more. Reload updates can only be applied by the user closing or switching from the app. This is due to a bug in iOS's webkit implementation.

``switchStream``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Platforms: Mobile**

Switches the ``reload`` stream the app will download updates from.

.. js:function:: reload.switchStream(stream_name, success, error)

    :param function() success: Stream switched
    :param function(content) error: called with details of any error which may occur

``updateReady.addListener``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Platforms: Mobile**

Fired when a Reload update has been downloaded and is ready to apply.

.. js:function:: reload.updateReady.addListener(callback, error)

    :param function() callback: an update will be applied next time the app resumes
    :param function(content) error: called with details of any error which may occur

Update process
--------------

The ``reload`` update process has several parts. First, it must be determined if an update is available, and if it is available it needs to be downloaded. Once an update has been downloaded it has to be applied, this means making the new files available to the app. If the app is running while an update is applied then there may need to be additional code in the app to make use of the updated files.

The following things will cause ``reload`` to download new update files if available:

* A call to ``forge.reload.update()``.
* On all platforms new files will be downloaded shortly after the app is launched.
* On Android and iOS new files will also be downloaded when the app loses focus but is running in the background.
* On Android new files will also be downloaded when the app exits.

Assuming an update has been fully downloaded and is ready to apply the following things will replace the apps assets files with the new update:

* On all platforms when the app is relaunched (i.e. when it has been quit and opened again).
* On iOS and Android when the app is restored from the background.

If updates are applied during launching or restoring an app ``index.html`` will be reloaded with the new update files.

Notes
-----

* Updates may take some time if the user is on a slow network, however several things are done to improve this, only changed files are downloaded in an update, and if an update is interrupted part way through it will resume where it left off next time it is started.
* On iOS updates are given 10 minutes to download each time the app is paused as this is the maximum amount of background processing time available on iOS. If an update is interrupted it will resume where it left off on the next attempt.
* Only one update is downloaded at a time, if an update is waiting to be applied any future updates will not be downloaded until it has been applied to the app. This should never be a problem for real users but may be confusing during testing.
* When testing the easiest way to cause an update is to leave the app by pressing the home button on the device, wait a few seconds (or look at the log output to see when the reload update is complete), and reopen the app to see the update applied.
