Possible Extensions
===================

If the tutorial has piqued your interest and you are looking for
some more improvements to the weather app here are a few suggestions.

- The current UI is still quite basic. Why not add some CSS or change up the layout?
- Custom themes. Have a UI that allows the user to select a theme which is saved to preferences and persists after restarts
- Set the color of the temperature based on a numeric range
- The data returned by the weather API has loads more fields - customise the app for whatever your needs are

More challenging:

 * Use geolocation to determine the current lat/lng
 * Using reverse geocoding determine the current city (see http://trigger.io/cross-platform-application-development-blog/2012/05/15/how-to-build-a-location-based-hybrid-mobile-app-with-reverse-geocoding/)
 * Use the information to look up the forecast for the current location

You could take a look at the :ref:`Forge API<modules>` documentation to help you implement this functionality or as a source of inspiration.
